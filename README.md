Here’s an example of a **GitHub README** file for your project that includes a clock, stopwatch, and timer functionality. The README provides a detailed overview, instructions for setup, usage, and contributions.

# React Clock, Stopwatch, and Timer

A React-based application that provides a real-time **Clock**, along with **Stopwatch** and **Timer** functionality. The time is displayed in `HH:MM:SS` format, and users can easily switch between the different modes to track or measure time.

## Features

- **Clock**: Displays the current time in `HH:MM:SS` format.
- **Stopwatch**: Measures elapsed time with start, pause, and reset functionality.
- **Timer**: Allows setting a countdown timer, with pause, start, and reset options.
